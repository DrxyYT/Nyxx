# What are the commands?
Since I figured out how to do slash commands, Enter **/help** for normal commands. And **/modhelp** for moderation commands.

# Nyxx is offline. Why is that?
There could be a few reasons why Nyxx is offline.
- I disabled her when Im done testing commands
- My computer is off or dead.
- I'm done coding for now.

# If you make the files public, are you gonna include your bot token?
Of course not dumbo. If you want the bot for yourself, Go to the Discord Dev Portal. Make a new app. Go to the bot section. Reset and copy the token. Paste the token where it says "BOT_TOKEN_HERE". Then run the code.

# Do you have the old version of Nyxx?
Yes, I do in fact. I'll post that to just in case you guys want to use the old Nyxx. Again, If you want the bot for yourself, Go to the Discord Dev Portal. Make a new app. Go to the bot section. Reset and copy the token. Paste the token where it says "BOT_TOKEN_HERE". Then run the code.

# If we have problems with Nyxx, how can we reach you?
There are two ways.
- My Discord: **defnot.drxy**
- Or my GitHub email: drxygithub@gmail.com.
