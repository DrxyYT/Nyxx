# Nyxx
My Public bot for Discord.

# How to use?
If you're in the server, I'll post the bot invite to add her to your server.

# What are the commands?
Since I figured out how to do slash commands, Enter **/help** for normal commands. And **/modhelp** for moderation commands.

# Nyxx is offline. Why is that?
Now that Nyxx is online 24/7 with https://diresnode.com/ The server can have downtime.

Check, https://status.diresnode.com/ for status. (Nyxx is using EU-4)

# If you make the files public, will you include your bot token?
Of course not dumbo. If you want the bot, Go to the Discord Dev Portal. Make a new app. Go to the bot section. Reset and copy the token. Paste the token where it says "BOT_TOKEN_HERE". Then run the code.

# If we have problems with Nyxx, how can we reach you?
There are two ways.
- My Discord: **defnot.drxy**
- Or my GitHub email: drxygithub@gmail.com.
